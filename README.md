# Technical Challenge

**To complete this exercise successfully, you need to do the following:**

1.  Clone this repo to your computer.
2.  Import `WW-Exercise-01` project into Android Studio.
3.  Read and implement the [User Stories](#user-stories) below.
4.  Run the application in the Emulator or on an Android device.
5.  Ensure the app displays correctly when the orientation changes.
6.  Submit your completed updates to this repo using a pull request.

Please implement the [Roxie](https://github.com/WW-Tech/roxie) architecture and use any libraries you feel are necessary. We are looking to see what production quality code looks like to you. 
Please avoid using code generators like [http://androidstarters.com](http://androidstarters.com) as the team will not be able to evaluate your work.

**User Stories**

1.  As a user, when I make a request to the endpoint, [https://www.weightwatchers.com/assets/cmx/us/messages/collections.json](https://www.weightwatchers.com/assets/cmx/us/messages/collections.json), then I would like to see an image and title of each object in the response.
2.  As a user, when I click on an item, then I would like to see a snackbar showing the filter associated with the item.
3.  As a user, when I rotate my device, I would like to maintain my state.
4.  Implement tests for the code you wrote.

**Bonus Points**

*  Support dark mode in your design
*  Display a placeholder image if the URL is invalid.
*  Display an empty state view if the response is empty.
*  Display an error message if the request fails.
*  Add additional features you think would be great. Some examples could be search, favorites, etc.
